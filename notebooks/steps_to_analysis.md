1. **Descriptive Statistics**: Compute summary statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, min, max, etc., for numeric columns (`Air temperature [K]`, `Process temperature [K]`, `Rotational speed [rpm]`, `Torque [Nm]`, `Tool wear [min]`, `Target`).

2. **Data Visualization**:
   - Plot histograms for numeric columns to visualize the distribution of data.
   - Plot boxplots to identify outliers and compare distributions.
   - Use scatter plots to explore relationships between variables.

3. **Categorical Analysis**:
   - Count the frequency of different types of products (`Type` column).
   - Count the frequency of different failure types (`Failure Type` column).

4. **Correlation Analysis**: Compute correlations between numeric variables to identify any linear relationships.

5. **Feature Selection**: Select features to use in the model.

6. **Model Selection**: Select the best model for the dataset.

7. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the model on the test set.

8. **Model Deployment**: Deploy the model in production.

9. **Conclusion**: Summarize the findings and recommendations.
