1. **Descriptive Statistics**: Compute summary statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, min, max, etc., for numeric columns (`Air temperature [K]`, `Process temperature [K]`, `Rotational speed [rpm]`, `Torque [Nm]`, `Tool wear [min]`, `Target`).

2. **Data Visualization**:
   - Plot histograms for numeric columns to visualize the distribution of data.
   - Plot boxplots to identify outliers and compare distributions.
   - Use scatter plots to explore relationships between variables.

3. **Categorical Analysis**:
   - Count the frequency of different types of products (`Type` column).
   - Count the frequency of different failure types (`Failure Type` column).

4. **Correlation Analysis**: Compute correlations between numeric variables to identify any linear relationships.

5. **Target Analysis**: Explore the distribution of the target variable (`Target`) and its relationship with other variables.

6. **Failure Analysis**: Investigate patterns in failure types and their relationships with other variables.

7. **Time Series Analysis** (if applicable): If your dataset includes timestamps, you can perform time series analysis to identify trends, seasonality, etc.

8. **Machine Learning Modeling**: Depending on your goals, you can train predictive models to predict the target variable or failure types.
